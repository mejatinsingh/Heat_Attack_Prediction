# Heat_Attack_Prediction
This is to understand the heat disease in a patient using the known 13 features like the age,gender and ST wave value and others
The study is to understand the prediction accuracy of the algorithms
I have used 5 algo in here and the confussion matrix will illustrate the accuracy of the algo with the actual and predicted value.

Features:
1.	age
2.	sex
3.	chest pain type (4 values)
4.	resting blood pressure
5.	serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.	fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.	resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.	maximum heart rate achieved
9.	exercise induced angina
10.	oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.	the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.	number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.	thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14.	The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
